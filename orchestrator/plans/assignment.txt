Build a simple To-Do application with real-time sync.

Backend (ASP.NET Core and GraphQL):
- Define Task { id, title, description, status }
- Mutations: createTask, updateTaskStatus
- Query: getAllTasks
- Real-time: Subscription taskChanged
- Use Entity Framework Core with SQLite for persistence

Frontend (React):
- Use Adobe React Spectrum to add tasks and toggle status (Pending or Completed)
- Fetch and display via GraphQL, prefer Relay client

Dockerization:
- Dockerize backend and frontend; compose orchestrates both

Meta:
- Use agentic automation to generate everything end-to-end, then run tests
- Output a working repo, passing tests, an optional short demo video, and a final report
